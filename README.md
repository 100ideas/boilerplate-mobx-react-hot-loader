cd boilerplate-mobx-react-hot-loader

*note:** as of 2019-07-25 the mobx react-hot-loader example had outdated packages (`mobx`, `react`, `react-dom`, `react-hot-loader`). Upgrade them the work with `react@^16.8.6`. Then alias `react-dom` to `./node_modules/@hot-loader/react-dom' in `webpack.conf`.
